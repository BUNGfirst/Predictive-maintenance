# Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning to predict potential failures in industrial machines using the AI4I 2020 dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Machine Predictive Maintenance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance)
- Features include: air temperature, process temperature, torque, tool wear, machine type, failure types

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- [Optionally] Power BI / Tableau for dashboarding

## 🧠 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Building and evaluating classification models (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Visualization of results

## 🎯 Goal
Predict whether a machine is likely to fail, and provide actionable insights for maintenance planning.
